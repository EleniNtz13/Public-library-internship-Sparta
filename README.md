### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

During the internship, I worked with several technologies to build a complete web development environment and support the library’s internal system:

| Technology / Tool                | Purpose                                            | Emoji |

| 📊 **Excel**                     | Recording uncatalogued book data                   | 📑    |
| 📡 **RFID System**               | Identifying books via tag-based IDs                | 🔖    |



### 📖 Project Overview

The main focus of the internship was to set up a complete development environment for a simple library management system.
This included:

- Creating two basic web servers (Python Flask & PHP)
- Running PHP through Apache for a stable local setup
- Setting up and managing a MySQL database
- Working with Django and PostgreSQL for future system expansion
- Using Excel to organize library book data
- Learning to operate the RFID system, used for fast identification and tracking of library materials

Together, these tools form the foundation of a system capable of handling book records, user activity, and dynamic website content.


### ⚙️ Setup Summary (High-Level)

- Python / Flask: Built a lightweight server for testing HTML responses
- PHP & Apache: Served PHP pages both locally and through Apache
- MySQL: Created and managed local databases for book records
- Django & PostgreSQL: Prepared environment for future development
- Excel & CSV: Organized uncatalogued book data for import
- RFID: Used tag identifiers to locate books efficiently

*(Detailed installation steps will be documented in a separate README.)*

### 🎯 Goals Achieved

- ✔️ Built a functional development environment
- ✔️ Created simple web servers in Python and PHP
- ✔️ Connected the system to a MySQL database
- ✔️ Configured Apache to serve PHP pages
- ✔️ Prepared Django + PostgreSQL for next steps
- ✔️ Assisted in library cataloging through Excel
- ✔️ Worked with RFID book identification technology


### 🧠 Tools Used

- ChatGPT – assistance with code and documentation
- GitHub Copilot – development support


### 📌 Additional Work

Alongside the technical setup, I worked extensively with Excel to record books that were not yet cataloged so they could later be added to the database.
I also gained experience with the RFID tracking system, which allows quick identification of books using the unique ID stored on each tag.
